I was given a webpage that didn't meet accessibility standards.

Now, when I view the source code, I find semantic HTML elements because of the semantic changes I made to fir HTML5 standards.

When I viewed the structure of the HTML elements, I found that the elements didn't follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Now that I made changes, they flow smoothly.

WHEN I viewed the image elements, I find was unable to find accessible alt attributes. I have added them to the images.

When I view the heading attributes, they now fall in sequential order.

WHEN I view the title element, I find a concise, descriptive title.
